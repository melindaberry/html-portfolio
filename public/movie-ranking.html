<h1>Melinda's Top Movies</h1>
<h2>My top three movies this year</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1. Billy Madison</h3> 
<p>This movie will always be my #1 movie because of its humor. At first, I used to find the more immature aspects the best. I also loved the quotability of this movie. Now, I enjoy the funny relationships each character has with one another. Oh and that musical number at the end is amazing. 10/10 recommend.</p>
<h3>2. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</h3>
<p>The Harry Potter books started to be released just as I was turning 11 years old - The same age as Harry in the first book. I will never forget how cool these stories were. So when the first movie came out, I couldn't believe that something so amazing could be seen on the big screen. It was like my imagination let loose! I always recommend students and friends to read these books and see these movies. They will change your lives! 10/10 recommend.</p>
<h3>3. Pride and Prejudice (2005)</h3>
<p>Any Jane Austen novel is going to be a hit to me. But there is something special about this story. It has been retold a million different ways and depicted in dozens of hit movies over the years and it never gets old. But the 2005 adaptation with Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfayden is top tier in my book. The dialogue is spot on with the book (brava screenwriters) and the acting is supreme. I can get caught up in this movie for weeks, just replaying my favorite scenes or lines over and over again.</p>
